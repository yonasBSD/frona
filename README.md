Frona is a personal AI assistant. You create autonomous agents that browse the web, run code, build applications, make phone calls, connect to messaging channels, delegate work to each other, and remember context across conversations, all within sandboxed environments with controlled access to your files, network, and credentials. You give them a task and they figure out how to get it done.

You deploy Frona on your own infrastructure and keep full control of your data. The platform is built from the ground up with security in mind, and the engine is written in Rust. So it's fast, lightweight, and runs everything in a single process.

## Security First

AI agents are powerful. They can execute code, browse websites, and access your data. No platform can make LLMs perfectly safe. They will make mistakes. The goal is to isolate those mistakes and reduce the blast radius when they happen.

- **Per-principal sandboxing:** every actor (agent, MCP server, app, channel) is its own principal with its own policies. Each CLI tool call, each MCP server, each deployed app runs in its own sandboxed Linux process with policy-driven syscall filtering. There's no Docker container per agent and no daemon to manage; the engine spawns and reaps sandboxes on demand
- **One policy engine:** tool access *and* sandbox rules (read/write paths, network destinations, port binds) are written in the same policy language and evaluated by a single engine. One language, one decision point, no glue code between authorization and isolation
- **Isolated browser sessions:** each user gets separate browser profiles. Different credentials get separate browser states. One user's cookies and sessions are never visible to another
- **Credential vault:** agents request credentials when they need them, and you approve or deny in real time. Supports 1Password, Bitwarden, HashiCorp Vault, KeePass, and Keeper. Secrets are never stored in agent memory or sent to LLM providers
- **Dual LLM dispatch on inbound:** untrusted channel messages can be routed to a quarantined LLM with a restricted tool registry, so a hostile inbound message can't talk the agent into running tools or leaking data on its behalf
- **Self-hosted by design:** your data lives on your servers. You choose which LLM provider to use, and traffic goes directly from your instance to that provider

## Features

- **Autonomous agents with tools:** agents decide which tools to use and execute multi-step tasks on their own. Agents can also build their own tools
- **Channels:** connect agents to messaging channels so the same agent, with the same memory and tools, follows you outside the web UI. Pairing flows lock channels to your devices by default
- **Signals:** an agent can pause a conversation and wait for a matching inbound (a 2FA code, a reply, a class of message) and resume automatically when something arrives, or run continuous monitors with structured results
- **MCP with bridge mode:** install [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers from the public registry in a click. Bridge mode advertises a single `mcpctl` CLI to the LLM instead of every MCP tool individually, saving thousands of tokens per turn on agents with many servers connected
- **Browser automation:** headless Chrome via Browserless for navigating websites, filling forms, and extracting data. Persistent browser profiles keep sessions across conversations
- **Web search:** built-in search via SearXNG, Tavily, or Brave Search
- **Code execution:** sandboxed shell, Python, and Node.js with per-principal filesystem, network, and resource restrictions
- **App deployment:** agents build and deploy web applications and services on your behalf, with an approval workflow before anything goes live
- **Skills:** instruction packages that teach agents new capabilities. Install shared skills or create agent-specific ones
- **Scheduling and heartbeats:** recurring tasks via cron and agent-managed heartbeat checklists for ongoing monitoring
- **Voice calls:** outbound phone calls via Twilio with speech recognition and DTMF navigation (optional)
- **Persistent memory:** agents remember facts across conversations with automatic compaction and deduplication. User-scoped facts are shared across agents, agent-scoped facts are private
- **Agent-to-agent delegation:** agents hand off tasks to specialized agents and get results back
- **Spaces:** group conversations that share context. The platform summarizes linked conversations and feeds the context into new chats
- **Notifications:** agents push status updates (task finished, app deployed, credential needs approval) into a feed in the top bar so nothing important gets lost
- **Real-time streaming:** token-by-token response streaming over Server-Sent Events
- **SSO:** OpenID Connect support for single sign-on with Google, Keycloak, and other OIDC providers
- **Single-container deployment:** the entire backend (API server, embedded database, scheduler, tool execution) runs in one rootless OCI container (compatible with Docker, Podman, and other OCI runtimes). No per-agent containers, even at scale

## Core Concepts

- **Agents** are the main building blocks. Each agent has a name, a system prompt that defines its behavior, a model group that determines which LLM it uses, and a list of tools it can access. Frona ships with built-in agents (Assistant, Researcher, Developer, Receptionist) and you can create your own.
- **Policies** authorize every action: tool calls, delegations, file reads, network connections, and inbound channel messages. The same engine controls tool access and sandbox rules, so authorization lives in one place.
- **Memory** lets agents remember things across conversations. There are user-scoped facts (shared across all agents) and agent-scoped facts (private to one agent). The platform automatically compacts and deduplicates memories over time.
- **Tools** are capabilities you give to agents. Browser automation, web search, file operations, shell commands, voice calls, task scheduling, and more. Tools run server-side and return results to the agent.
- **MCP servers** are first-class citizens. Each runs in its own sandbox as its own principal with its own filesystem, network, and resource policies, and surfaces its tools to agents through bridge mode by default.
- **Channels** connect an agent to messaging providers. Each channel is bound to a single agent and space, with policy-gated `receive_message` and `receive_signal` actions deciding what an inbound is allowed to do.
- **Signals** are "wait for X to happen" tasks. An agent calls `await_signal` and the conversation resumes when an inbound message matches.
- **Tasks** represent units of work. They can be direct (run immediately), delegated (from one agent to another), or scheduled (recurring via cron expressions).
- **Chat** is how you interact with agents. Each conversation belongs to one agent, but multiple agents can contribute to it through delegation. Messages stream in real-time over Server-Sent Events.
- **Spaces** are groups of chats that share the same context. When you link conversations to a space, the platform summarizes those conversations and feeds the context back into new chats.
- **Skills** are instruction packages you install on agents. They can be built-in, shared across all agents, or scoped to a single agent.

## Quickstart

You'll need an OCI runtime with Compose v2 support, such as [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/).

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  frona:
    image: ghcr.io/fronalabs/frona:latest
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      - FRONA_BROWSER_WS_URL=ws://browserless:3333
      - FRONA_SEARCH_SEARXNG_BASE_URL=http://searxng:8080
    # Only needed if you plan to restrict agent network destinations.
    # See https://docs.frona.ai/platform/security/sandbox.html
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
    depends_on:
      - browserless
      - searxng
    restart: unless-stopped

  browserless:
    image: ghcr.io/browserless/chromium:v2.24.2
    environment:
      - MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS=10
      - PREBOOT_CHROME=true
    volumes:
      - ./data/browser_profiles:/profiles
    restart: unless-stopped

  searxng:
    image: searxng/searxng:latest
    environment:
      - SEARXNG_BASE_URL=http://searxng:8080
      - SEARXNG_SECRET=change-me-to-something-random
    configs:
      - source: searxng-settings
        target: /etc/searxng/settings.yml
    restart: unless-stopped

configs:
  searxng-settings:
    content: |
      use_default_settings: true
      search:
        formats:
          - html
          - json
```

```bash
docker compose up -d   # or: podman compose up -d
open http://localhost:3001
```

The setup wizard will guide you through creating your account and configuring your LLM provider.

See the [docker-compose example](examples/docker-compose) for a full deployment with environment configuration, the [documentation](https://docs.frona.ai) for detailed guides, or [screenshots](https://docs.frona.ai/platform/screenshots.html) to see the platform in action.

## Providers

Frona auto-discovers providers from your configuration and routes different tasks to the right one. Configure them in the [config file](https://docs.frona.ai/platform/deployment/config-file.html).

**LLM:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral, Cohere, xAI (Grok), Groq, OpenRouter, Together, Perplexity, Hyperbolic, Moonshot, Hugging Face, Mira, Galadriel, Ollama (local).

**Search:** SearXNG (self-hosted), Tavily, Brave Search.

**Voice:** Twilio.

**Channels:** Telegram, SMS (more on the way).

## Architecture

Frona has two main components:

- **Engine:** a Rust backend (Axum) that handles agents, chat, tools, authentication, the policy engine, and an embedded SurrealDB database with RocksDB storage. The engine spawns sandboxed child processes for tool calls, MCP servers, and apps; it does not spin up containers per agent
- **Frontend:** a Next.js application that provides the chat interface, agent management, and workspace UI

External services plug in for specific capabilities:

- **Browserless:** headless Chrome for browser automation
- **SearXNG:** web search
- **Twilio:** voice calls and SMS (optional)

Everything runs in OCI containers and works with any OCI-compatible runtime (Docker, Podman, etc.). A typical deployment is a single `docker-compose.yml` that brings up the engine, frontend, and supporting services. See the [Kubernetes example](examples/kubernetes) for cluster deployments.
