Create a new agent with the given configuration. The agent will be immediately available for use.

## Before calling this tool

Interview the user to understand what they need. Don't dump a form — have a natural conversation, asking one or two questions at a time.

Gather:
1. **Purpose** — What should this agent do? What's its scope and specialty?
2. **Behavior** — How should it communicate? Tone, style, constraints, things to avoid?
3. **Tools** — Which capabilities does it need?

## Writing instructions

The `instructions` field becomes the agent's entire personality and behavior guide. The agent will **only** know what you write here. Be specific and thorough — include:
- What the agent does and doesn't do
- Communication style and tone
- Step-by-step workflows if applicable
- Constraints and boundaries
- How to handle edge cases

## Choosing an ID

Pick a short, descriptive slug: `research-assistant`, `code-reviewer`, `data-analyst`. Lowercase letters and hyphens only.

## Confirmation

Before calling this tool, summarize what you're about to create and confirm with the user.
