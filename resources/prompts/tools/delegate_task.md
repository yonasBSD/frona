The default delegation tool. Delegate a task to another agent — fire-and-forget. The result is posted directly to this chat for the user; your tool loop is NOT resumed. Returns immediately with a task ID. Optionally set run_at to defer execution. For recurring scheduled work, use schedule_task. For periodic autonomous check-ins, use set_heartbeat.
