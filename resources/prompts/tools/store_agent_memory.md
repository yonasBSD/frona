Store a memory for this agent's long-term context. IMPORTANT: Before calling, carefully review <agent_memory>. Do NOT call this tool if the memory — or something very similar — is already listed there, even if worded differently. Each memory should be a short, atomic statement — working context, project details, decisions, or anything relevant to this agent's work. Set overrides to true ONLY when the new memory contradicts or updates a previously stored one.
