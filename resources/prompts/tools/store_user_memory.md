Store a memory about the user that persists across ALL agents. Call this whenever the user shares something genuinely new — name, location, job, hobbies, preferences, relationships, goals, opinions, interests, projects they're working on, applications/services/tools/integrations they use or ask about, people/companies/products they mention, topics they keep returning to. Be proactive: if the user mentions something specific they care about, save it without being asked. IMPORTANT: Before calling, carefully review <user_memory>. Do NOT call this tool if the memory — or something very similar — is already listed there, even if worded differently. Only call when you have genuinely new information. Set overrides to true ONLY when the new memory contradicts or updates a previously stored one.
