# Build

## How the Build Works

The Dockerfile is a multi-stage build with two final targets: `dev` and `prod`.

1. **frontend-builder** — `npm ci` + `npm run build` to produce a static export
2. **planner** — `cargo chef prepare` to fingerprint Rust dependencies
3. **backend-builder** — `cargo chef cook` (cached dependency build) then `cargo build --release`
4. **cli-tools** — downloads arch-specific binaries (1Password CLI, Bitwarden CLI, SydBox, SurrealDB) using Docker's `TARGETARCH`
5. **python-builder** — pip installs into a `/install` prefix
6. **prod** — minimal `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` image with the compiled binary, static frontend, CLI tools, and Python packages
7. **dev** — full `rust:1.89-bookworm` toolchain with cargo-watch hot-reload and Node.js

Rust dependency caching relies on [cargo-chef](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef) — dependencies are compiled once from `recipe.json` and cached across builds as long as `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock` don't change.

## Version Pinning

Build dependencies are version-locked in `build/pkgs/` text files (`name=version` format):

- `prod-pkgs.txt` — CLI tool versions (op, bw, syd)
- `builder-rust-cargo.txt` — Cargo tools (cargo-chef)
- `builder-python-pip.txt` — Python packages (pandas, numpy, scipy, etc.)

SurrealDB is the exception — its version is extracted from `Cargo.lock` at build time so it always matches the Rust dependency.

Base images are pinned to major/minor versions. APT packages (`*-apt.txt`) are not version-pinned and resolve at build time.

## Multi-Architecture Docker Builds

Builds use Docker Buildx to produce `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` images. By default, a single local builder handles both platforms via QEMU emulation.

### Remote amd64 Builder

For faster amd64 builds, add a remote amd64 server as a native buildx node instead of relying on QEMU.

**Prerequisites:** Docker installed on the remote server, accessible via SSH.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Remove existing builder (if it claims both platforms on one node)
docker buildx rm multiarch

# Local node — arm64 only
docker buildx create --name multiarch --platform linux/arm64

# Remote node — amd64 only
docker buildx create --name multiarch --append \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  ssh://user@your-amd64-server

docker buildx use multiarch
docker buildx inspect multiarch --bootstrap
```

Each node must be constrained to its native platform with `--platform`. Without this, the local node claims both `linux/arm64` and `linux/amd64`, and buildx routes amd64 builds through QEMU instead of the remote node.

**Verify:** `docker buildx inspect multiarch` should show two nodes, each with a single platform.

### Publishing

```bash
mise run docker:publish
```

This builds for both platforms and pushes to `ghcr.io/fronalabs/frona:latest`. See `publish.sh` for details.

## Releasing
